agent: agent

I want you to create workstream.md and divide the work into independent parts. You decide how many agents to work in parallel in the same codebase without conflict, so that we can implement this simultaneously.

Sample workstream.md file will look like

Workstream A
All details and points

Workstream B
All details and points

and so on until all remaining features/work is exhausted.
