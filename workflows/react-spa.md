## Task

This command guides React SPA implementation with modern patterns and state management.

### Steps:

1. **Clarify scope**
   - New SPA or feature update
   - Routing needs
   - State management needs

2. **Select core skills**
   - React architecture: `react-patterns`
   - State strategy: `react-state-management`
   - Performance and best practices: `vercel-react-best-practices`

3. **Plan structure**
   - Components vs containers
   - State placement (local, context, global, server)
   - Routing setup (react-router)

4. **Implement**
   - TypeScript-first components
   - Error boundaries and loading states
   - Accessibility checks for interactive UI

5. **Verify**
   - Run lint and type checks
   - Validate key user flows
