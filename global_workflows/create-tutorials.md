description: Create tutorials for an app
---

Let's create a full fledged tutorial on each page on how to use the app. Keep the page specific tutorials concise and crisp. But don't allow them to dismiss it easily. they need to run through it at least once, and make sure they also don't just skip through it in rapid succession by clicking next without actually following the to tutorial by adding a timer and disabling the next button until it expires. Only on the last step of the tutorial, show an option to hide it permanently. Use standard next, prev buttons on the call outs, but don't provide a dismiss button. 
Slowly plan, and determine the best guidance for new users on how to utilize the app. Each time they navigate to a page, show them that until it's permanently disabled, saved in firebase in their account. Create a setting in profile page to reset tutorial state.
